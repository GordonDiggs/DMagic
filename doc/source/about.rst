Data collection at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) can generate massive 
amount of data and often the beamline staff can be overwhelmed by 
routine data management tasks like sharing, distributing and archiving.

The data management python toolbox aims to provide easy command-like
instruction to automate the majority of beamline scientist data 
management tasks. The toolbox has been develop to support the APS Imaging 
Group data management activities but it can be easily adopted and implemented
at any beamline. 

The data management python toolbox relies on automatic access to the  
`APS scheduling system <https://schedule.aps.anl.gov/>`__ 
and makes extent use of `Globus <https://www.globus.org/>`__
